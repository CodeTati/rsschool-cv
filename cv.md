Briefly About Myself:
Having started my career as a private teacher, I've got opportunity to work in different countries. I was working in China, Beijing for 6 month, in Germany, Hamburg for 2 years and in Cyprus, Limassol for 2 years.

Iâ€™m interested in Web Development because this kind of job offers possibilities for professional growth, attain a leadership role,increase earnings and a big community of developers as well.
